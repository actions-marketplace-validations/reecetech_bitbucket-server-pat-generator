# ü™£ Bitbucket Server PAT Generator

## ü§ù Introduction

[Bitbucket Server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/enterprise)
(nee [Stash](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-rebrand-faq-779298912.html))
can hand out Personal Access Tokens (PAT) to be used in-place of user+password authentication.

When machine (rather than human) access to Stash is required, ideally it should be via short-lived credentials.  This
GitHub Action will take user+password credentials, and use them to generate a PAT.  Your GitHub Actions workflow should
then use the PAT whenever authenticating to Stash.

**Wait. What?  ü§î**

_Why would you use a PAT if you have a user+password already?_

Ideally this GitHub Action is used in conjunction with [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), which will
automatically rotate the Stash user's password (e.g. using the
[AD secrets engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ad)).  This means during an execution of a (relatively 
long running) GitHub Actions workflow, the password could _change_ from the value originally obtained from Vault.

Obtaining a PAT allows us to avoid this issue, since the PAT will not be rotated (or used again).

**Not perfect**

This isn't the perfect way to go about getting a PAT from Stash for GitHub Actions when Vault is in the mix.  The ideal
solution is to create a new [Vault secrets engine](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/plugin-backends) that
would connect to Stash directly and generate the PAT.  This would
simplify the implementation on the GitHub Actions side, since you could just use the Hashicorp Vault Action.

We have chosen not to create a new Vault secrets engine, as we could deliver this GitHub Action more quickly and simply
(as opposed to creating, building, publishing and installing a Vault plugin).

## üìÑ Use

### ‚å®Ô∏è Example

```yaml
      - name: Get creds from Vault
        id: vault
        uses: hashicorp/vault-action@v2.4.0
        with:
          url: https://vault.example.org/
          method: jwt
          exportEnv: false
          secrets: |
              ad/creds/svc_github_stash username | username ;
              ad/creds/svc_github_stash current_password | password

      - name: Get PAT for Stash
        id: stash
        uses: reecetech/bitbucket-server-pat-generator@2022.2.4
        with:
          base_url: https://stash.example.org/
          username: ${{ steps.vault.outputs.username }}
          password: ${{ steps.vault.outputs.password }}

      - name: Clone repo from Stash
        uses: reecetech/git-clone@2021.11.1
        with:
          url: https://stash.example.com/scm/example/repo.git
          username: ${{ steps.vault.outputs.username }}
          password: ${{ steps.stash.outputs.pat }}
```

### üì• Inputs

üöß To be completed

| name      | description                                               | required | default  |

| username        | The username to connect to Stash                                   |
| pat             | The personal access token to use to connect to Stash               |
| pat_id          | The ID of the PAT which can be used to revoke the token            |

### üöß Limitations

Currently the Action will only generate PATs with REPO_WRITE and PROJECT_WRITE permissions.  Further contributions
are required to support either read-only or admin PATs.
